# scheduler-spike


A spike to see see if I can use node-schedule for existing scheduled jobs. SQL redacted...

This is probably more interesting for future-me for having got the jasmine unit tests working when the main project is written in TypeScript.

`npm test` to run the tests.

`npm start` to run.

Scheduled queries are loaded from the `scheduledqueries.json` file.
